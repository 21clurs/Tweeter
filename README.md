Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to take a second look at the way I am implementing the view self profile and view other user's profile functionalities. I have them working right now, but I feel that it is fairly unelegant.
2.

## Notes

- Challenges with understanding how to use the Twitter API at first, this got better as I used it more
- I didn't completely understand delegates and tried using them nonetheless, probably causing a lot of my delegate functions to be kind of pointless. I think I have a better understanding of them now, so I would definitely like to go back and fix these if I have the chance.
